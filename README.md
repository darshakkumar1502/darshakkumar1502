### Description:
I have completed a 3-month internship in web development, where I worked with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). During the internship, I gained hands-on experience with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and learned the basics of **React.js**, **MongoDB**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**. I was part of a team project called **Fabric India**, where my main responsibility was handling the frontend development, ensuring that the user interface was functional and user-friendly.
